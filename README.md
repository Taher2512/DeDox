## Overview

DeDox is an innovative decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana blockchain, designed to revolutionize document storage, verification, and signing processes. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeDox ensures the immutability and security of important documents while providing a seamless signing experience.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Blockchain-Based Document Storage**: Securely store critical documents on the Solana blockchain.
- üñãÔ∏è **Decentralized Signing System**: Specify signers using their wallet addresses for easy document access and signing.
- üîí **Blockchain-Verified Signatures**: All signatures are recorded on the Solana blockchain, creating an unalterable proof of signing.
- ü§≥ **Identity Verification**: Basic KYC process using selfies stored on IPFS with hashes recorded on Solana.
- üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive slider mechanism for signing and comprehensive document information display.

## How It Works

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload important documents to the blockchain via DeDox.
2. **Signer Designation**: During upload, the document owner specifies signers using their Solana wallet addresses.
3. **Notification**: Designated signers see the document in their DeDox app when logged in with the specified wallet address.
4. **Signing Process**: Signers use a simple slider button to sign the document, recording their signature on the blockchain.
5. **Verification**: The app displays signing status, including the number of signatures, signers' photos, and the document image.
